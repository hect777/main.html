    		<span><p class="wikiinfo">The 2018 Mosconi Cup, (also known as Mosconi Cup XXV)[4] was the 25th edition of the annual nine-ball pool competition between teams representing Europe and the United States. It took place between 4–7 December 2018 at the Alexandra Palace in London, England and was sponsored by partypoker.[5][6]

			The reigning champions were team Europe, who had won the last eight cups, including the 2017 Mosconi Cup 11–4. The event was played with teams of 5, decided by captains, and also performances in the tour.[7] The team's non-playing captains were the same as the previous year: Marcus Chamat for Europe and Johan Ruijsink for the United States. Ruijsink, who had won the Cup as captain with team Europe seven times, was assisted by vice captain Jeremy Jones.[8]

			The United States won the Mosconi Cup for the first time since 2009, defeating Europe 11-9, ending an 8-year losing streak for the USA.

				<div class="pbox"><p>Corey Deuel (born November 20, 1977 in Santa Barbara, California) is an American professional pocket billiards (pool) player from West Jefferson, Ohio. Nicknamed "Cash Money", he is an accomplished tournament competitor, having won the US Open Nine-ball Championship in 2001, as well as many other major titles. As of January 2008, Deuel is the second highest ranked pool player in the US by the United States Professional Poolplayers Association.[1] He regularly represents the USA in the Mosconi Cup. In 2010 he again was selected for the US team in the Mosconi Cup and was responsible for winning 2 of the 8 points that the US team won during that event.</p>

				<div class="pbox"><p>Woodward made his Team USA debut in 2015, and has made the team every year since, but is winless in three appearances.
				The “Kentucky Kid” struggled for form at last year’s Mosconi Cup, but has been working hard with Ruijsink this year and believes fans will see a much-improved player in London in December.</p>

				<div class="pbox"><p>Thorpe made his Mosconi Cup debut last year in Las Vegas and has traveled to major world events representing America this year. He had arguably the best tournament of any of the American players, winning a singles match and going one for three in doubles competition.
				“Billy is an intense competitor who always tries his hardest,” said Ruijsink. “He is young and wild, which makes him incredibly hard to play against. He can run you over like a freight train. When he makes a mistake, you can be sure that he recovers and tries even harder. It is great to have him on the team. Off the table, there is always something happening around him, which is great fun and good for the team. He hasn’t reached his ceiling yet and I hope I can help him get there.”</p>
